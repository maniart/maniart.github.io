				use this function to setup your environment. things like creating your canvas,
				setting your background color, stroke weight for your lines, etc.
				generally, anything that you think will persist in your entire sketch.
				things you want to set up once and forget about.
				this function will run only once. 
				in other words, p5.js knows to execute this function once.
				remember, functions are machines that execute tasks.
				some times they take inputs (parameters) and some time they dont.

			name: background
			type: function
			what it does:
				set your background color. takes 3 parameters defining the `rgb` values of the color. the 3 numbers should be between 0 and 255.
				you can ALSO only pass 1 parameter to it. if so, that one parameter will be the shade of a grey color.

			name: draw
			type: function
			what it does:
				this function is executed over and over again at a very high rate (think `frame per second`).

				`for` loop
				a `for` loop is a statement that takes in 3 parameters:
				- a variable that can act as a counter, starting from a specific number (in this case, 0)
				- a condition. every time the `for` loop executes, this condition is checked. if the condition is `true`, the for loop will run one more time.
					but if the condition is false, the for loop will STOP runnign.
				- an expression to (in this case) increase our variable.

				This is how JavaScript executes the for loop below:
				1 - create a variable, call it `i` and store the number 0 in it.
				2 - is `i` less than the height of our canvas?
				3 - if so execute everytihng between `{` and `}` - we call this a `block` - in this case, our 
				4 - check to see if `i` is still smaller than `height`. is it?
				5 - if so, add `20` to `i` (at this point, `i` is 20)
				6 - execute the block.
				7 - check the condition (is `i` still smaller than `height?)
				8 - if the condition is still `true` 
				9 - run the code in the block `line(0,i,width,i)
				10 - continue recursively executing the loop until `i` is no longer smaller than `height` - in other words the `i < height` condition no longer meets.
