				use this function to setup your environment. things like creating your canvas,
				setting your background color, stroke weight for your lines, etc.
				generally, anything that you think will persist in your entire sketch.
				things you want to set up once and forget about.
				this function will run only once. 
				in other words, p5.js knows to execute this function once.
				remember, functions are machines that execute tasks.
				some times they take inputs (parameters) and some time they dont.

			type: function

				you can ALSO only pass 1 parameter to it. if so, that one parameter will be the shade of a grey color.

			type: function
